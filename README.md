# PokeAPI OIT Application Coding Challenge

Created by Jacob Thomsen, 2 March 2022.
This project was created as a part of an application for the BYU OIT Student Developer job position.


## Requirements / Program Functions

Using Python, this program can:

1.    Accept user input of a Pokemon type and return a list of Pokemon of the given type

2.    Allow the user to enter a name of a Pokemon. The given name must be from the information returned in step 1

3.    Return information for the entered Pokemon name including at least the games the Pokemon are in,
           all the types of the Pokemon, the name of one of the Pokemon's moves,
           and one other value of your choice related to the Pokemon.


## Running the program

If you have cloned the repository for this code or unzipped the project folder, 
enter the following commands to run the .exe version of the python script 'main.py':

`> cd venv/dist/main`

`> ./main`

The script should now be running and you can interact with the program.

The Python script itself is main.py and can be found in the `venv` folder


## Notes

In order to utilize the Python language and its dependencies
and make it accessible to any user, this program is bundled
with Pyinstaller. This program packages the script its
dependencies into a .exe file that does not require a local
Python interpreter to run the script.
